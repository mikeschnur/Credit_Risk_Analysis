# Credit_Risk_Analysis

# Overview

This project has tasked me with the challenge of predicting the risk attached when loaning money to an individual. We analyzed a dataset from LendingClub to predict whether a potential recpient of a loan would have high or low risk. Supervised Machine Learning models were used to make these predictions, the balanced accuracy score and imbalanced classification report for each model indicate the performance of each model.
